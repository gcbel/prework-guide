# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As my very first website, I made this study guide for the material I learned in the prework for the Columbia University
Full-Stack coding bootcamp. This website allows me to keep together all the notes I took for this first module and 
can hopefully be helpful as I continue on in this course. I learned skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, including 
how to set up a website and how to link Javascript and CSS files to an HTML.

## Usage

Each section of the website includes notes on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. These notes can be used to remember key
concepts moving forward in the course. The console shows the running Javacript, which lists topics we learned and can 
randomly select a topic for us to study first.
